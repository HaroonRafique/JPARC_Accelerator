calculation of J-PARC LINAC DTL and SDTL single gaps with DTLFISH

in folder "extract", extracted infos: T, S, etc., extracted from calculations
D1-1: DTL1 gaps 1-56 (aperture phi 130mm)
D1-2: DTL1 gaps 57-76 (aperture phi 180mm)
D2: DTL2, 43 gaps
D3: DTL3, 27 gaps
S1: SDTL01A to SDTL08B, 40pags
S2: SDTL09A to SDTL16B, 40pags
S3: SDTL17A to SDTL24B, 40pags
S4: SDTL25A to SDTL32B, 40pags


in folder "fielddataetc", pmi and SFO files:
DTL: DxGyy.pmi and DxGyy.SFO, xx=1,2,3, y the gap number
SDTL: SxGy.pmi and SxxyGzz.pmi, xx=01,…,16,y=A or B, zz=01,…,05 for index of tank and gap

ACS has it's own Readme.txt
