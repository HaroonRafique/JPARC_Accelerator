# JPARC Accelerator
The PyORBIT scripts and data related to the whole JPARC accelerator: Linac, RCS, and MR.

# JPARC Linac
At this moment it includes the SNS-stile XML JPARC's linac lattice file generator. The generator uses JPARC version of the XAL xml file as a source of the lattice data. 
It also includes test scripts for JPARC linac model for PyORBIT.
The PyORBIT code was also modified: the JPARC Lattice Factory (for linacs) was added, because the JPARC linac has some differencces from the SNS linac.

# JPARC RCS
At this moment we do not have anything about JPARC RCS.

# JPARC MR
At this moment we do not have anything about JPARC MR.
